Hi, I'm Whiskey Bob. Welcome to my blog. I've always enjoyed whiskey and decided to make the drink my main hobby in 2018. This blog chronicles my journey as I try whiskies from around the world. I write a post every day. I drink most days but also take many planned days off. I want this to remain a fun hobby. To that end, I'm very up front about my spending and alcohol intake. I've budgeted $1200 - $1800 for the year ($4/day @ 300 days to $5/day every day) and usually drink about 30 mL (1 oz) each day.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) and a modified [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
