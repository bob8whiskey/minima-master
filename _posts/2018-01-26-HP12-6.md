It's the penultimate day of Highland Park 12 week here at Whisky Bob's and I feel like doing something stupid...

How does HP12 pair with the finest of Domino's pepperoni pizzas? Turns out it goes down OK but loses most of its character. I get lots of smoke that goes well with the salty pepperoni but lose most of the upfront flavors. Some of the sweetness still comes through on the back end. This has been a long, long day without enough water and the alcohol really warms my chest. I'm just too tired so this is all the whisky for the day. This 25 mL pour cost $1.43 prorated from a $43 750 mL bottle.

Whisky Bob signing off.
