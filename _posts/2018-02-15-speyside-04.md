Tearing into my final 50 mL Speyside sampler tonight, Speyburn 10.

* Nose: More complex than the Glens of yesterday. Alcohol burn right off the bat followed by grass and light fruit notes
* Taste: Medium body. Lots of alcohol that burns away other flavors. Most of the taste is in the finish.
* Finish: Huge alcohol hit at first followed by grassy sweetness. Some earthiness. Drying on the tongue that I didn't notice until the second sip.

There's a lot going on here and I'm not sure it all comes together. There are some nice flavors in here but also a huge alcohol burn. I think I'd take this over the boring Glens, however. At least there's something going on.

I'll be back tomorrow mixing up my Speyside pairings.

Whisky Bob signing off.
