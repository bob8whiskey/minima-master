Long, long day of work on travel today. Grabbed a delightful dinner with a coworker and sampled an Old Fashioned. I think it came with some kind of bourbon. The nose was mostly citrus from the fresh orange peel. The taste was strong, sweet and bitter. I remember more about the conversation than the drink. Sometimes that's the way it should be.

Whiskey Bob signing off.
