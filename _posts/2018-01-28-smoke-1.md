To kick off smoke week, we're sampling from the three southern Islay distilleries today:


| Distillery | Expression | ABV | $/25mL | $/Bottle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Laphroaig | [10 year](https://www.laphroaig.com/product/laphroaig-10-year-old/) | 43% | $1.33 | $40/750mL |
| Lagavulin | [16 year](https://www.malts.com/en-us/our-whisky-collection/lagavulin/lagavulin-16-years-old/) | 43% | $2.17 | $65/750mL |
| Ardbeg | [Uigeadail](https://www.ardbeg.com/en-US/whisky/ultimate-range/uigeadail) | 54.2% | $3 | $6/50mL |


I'd prefer to sample the standard Ardbeg 10 year expression but can't justify another Islay on the shelf. I lucked into the 50 mL samplers of the Uigeadail for a decent price so that will suffice. On that note, I wish there were more single malts available in 50 mL samplers!

### Laphroaig 10 year

This has the lightest color (it's natural) and thinnest legs of the three. I get peat smoke, something medicinal and a lot of sea on the nose. There's some sort of lightness hiding there. The nose can be quite similar to the Laga16 when sniffed back and forth. The body is a medium syrup and is quite pleasing. My tastebuds are overwhelmed with peat smoke with a nice long ashy finish. I taste grass when I chew air.

### Lagavulin 16 year

This has the darkest color (caramel coloring has been added) and fairly long legs. Lots of peat smoke, sea and medicinal on the nose... it's a similar nose to the Laphroaig but also quite different. I don't yet have the vocabulary to explain the differences. This is the thinnest liquid with the lightest mouthfeel. There are sweet notes on the tongue. A drier finish and more smoke on the backend than the Laph10. There's also this wonderful medicinal iodine note missing in the Laph10... it's like sucking on bandaids but it's awesome. There ya go.

### Ardbeg Uigeadail

This guy was finished of in ex-sherry casks and non chill-filtered near cask-strength at 54.2% ABV making it a slightly different beast than the other two. The Islay peat sure is there but so is the sherry. I get a lot of red wine along with the smoke on the nose. It's easy to pick this one out because of the sherry. This has the heaviest mouthfeel by far and I'm not sure if it's just too thick for me. The flavor profile seems surprisingly simplistic - I get the smoke and the sherry and that's about it. There's a bit of drying and similar smoke on the backend. I'd like to try this with some water.

### Conclusions

The Laga is still my favorite. Something about that bandaid taste drives me crazy. The Laphroaig is the best value of the three at $40 and a solid introduction to Islays. I've heard prices on the Laga16 range from $45 to >$130. That's absolutely nuts. I love it but think the $60 range is about right. The Uigeadail has a wonderful reputation but I'm finding it rather simplistic. I'll have a few more chances as I bought another 50 mL bottle and also couldn't finish my dram tonight. I put it back in the bottle to try tomorrow. I also couldn't finish the Laga and left it in covered in the Glencairn... we'll revisit these tomorrow and see if they've changed.

### Bonus Mrs. Whisky Reactions

#### Uigeadail

Mrs. Whisky smells it. "So smelly." Tastes it. "Oh... that's the first one I would spit out if I had enough in my mouth to spit out. Getting some smokiness now. At first it was all burning alcohol. Ugghhhh... Grrrrr.... blahhhhh... I feel like I'm sucking on matches. No me gusta. Muahhhhhh."

"You should have snickers to hand out to bribe me for all this nastiness."

#### Lagavulin

"I like the smell of this one. It doesn't burn my nose. Taht last one was going to ignite my nose hairs. This one's kind of pleasant... I don't know, maybe it's sweeter. This one doesn't feel like it's going to knock me out before I take a sip."

Tastes it.

"Bluahhhhh... eewwwwww... uhhhhh.... This one isn't smokey. It tastes like moldy cheese or dirty socks. I don't know. I liked the way it smelled but not the way it tastes. I'm not a whisky drinker. I will continue to play your game but I will never change my mind about whisky."

#### Laphroaig

"Smells kind of vanilla-y."

Takes a sip, sticks tongue out.

"It burns. It didn't smell so smokey but I get a little bit on the back end. It's alright."

#### Mrs. Whisky Conclusions

"I don't like whisky. The third one one was my favorite of the three. The first was heinous. The second was yucky. It was like stinky feet. The third one is alright. Now I want to go promptly to sleep and forget this experiment ever happened."

There ya have it.
