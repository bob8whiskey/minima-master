Let's revisit the Laphroaig 10 alongside the Ardbeg 10. I poured 15 mL neat of each in Glencairns.

### Laphroaig 10

* Color: Much darker than the Ardbeg. It's artificial.
* Nose: Peat smoke, medicinal notes, salty seaside notes.
* Taste: Hits softer than the Ardbeg. Takes time to develop.
* Finish: More of the seaside brininess comes out.


### Ardbeg 10

* Color: Much lighter than the Laphroaig. I assume it's natural.
* Nose: Peat smoke, some sort of light citrusy sweetness. Less complex than the Laphroaig
* Taste: Ashy smoke hits right away. Much stronger than the Laphroaig.
* Finish: Long, deep finish. Packs a punch. Less going on but more to my tastes.

### Conclusion

The more I drink other Islays, the more I appreciate the subtleties of the Laphroaig. That said, I prefer the favor profile of the Ardbeg. But these are both mighty fine expressions and the "better" one comes down to personal preference.

I'll be back tomorrow to compare the three together.
