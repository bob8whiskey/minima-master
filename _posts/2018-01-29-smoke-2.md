Whisky Bob had a long, long day so this will be short. Sampling the Lagavulin 16 I couldn't finish last night and a fresh pour. The pour from last night was left neat in a Glencairn and covered overnight. I get a huge peaty smoke nose upon taking off the cover. The fresh pour has a much higher alcohol burn on the nose.

The overnighter tastes weak like a dying camp fire. Body seems to have the same viscosity yet is lacking something. There's still a nice smokey finish but the medicinal notes have retreated to the background. The finish is still nice... but maybe a bit more bitter or sour?

I stick my nose back in the fresh pour, now sitting a few minutes. Much more life here. I taste it. There's a fuller body, more drying on the finish, the nice complexity. In short, it's Lagavulin 16 the way God intended it to be.

I down the last gulp of yeserday's pour. The poor bastard. Friends, don't let this happen to you. Pour responsibly, drink responsibly.

Whisky Bob signing off.
