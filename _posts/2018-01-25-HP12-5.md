HP12 neat 25 mL pour into a Glencairn (cost $1.43 prorated from a $43 750 mL bottle). Nose: dull rubbing alcohol revealing a pleasant sweetness and light smokiness. Smells delicious. I have a new appreciation for this whisky after drinking the Lagavulin 16 yesterday. I really need to up my "smoke" vocabulary as these are smokey yet completely different. The HP12 has smoke and a medicinal quality on the backend. More sweetness on the nose. Drying and ashy finish. Really long pleasant finish.

Mrs. Whisky gives this a try. She sniffs it. "Not as burny as the last one." She tastes it - the liquid does not get past her lips. She grimaces but goes back for more. "My tongue is numb... but this is not the worst one I've tried." Goes back for one more sip. "So hot! Do you like this? It's still not as offensive as the other one..."

Mr. and Mrs. Whisky Bob signing off.
