I spent the day snowtubing with Whiskey Kid #1. We were just a few minutes away from a New Hampshire liquor barn and she graciously agreed to a quick trip. Fortunately for her, I had my shopping list ready and it was a quick trip. I picked up enough to fill out my 8 month plan (with one summer exception) and bring my yearly total up to ~$700. I've got too much whisky stock... better drink some of it!

The plan was to continue on with my Speyside tastings but I feel like a need a quick return to something I know before going back for further evaluation. That, and my most cherished acquisition today was the Ardbeg Explorer's pack for $48. This includes a 750 mL bottle of the standard Ardbeg 10 and 50 mL samplers of Uigeadail and Corryvreckan. This has to be the best value that I've yet come across. Thanks, New Hampshire!

So I return to Islay, my whisky home. I'm calling this sojourn "Kickin' in Kildalton" as I now possess the three standard expressions from the Kildalton distilleries on the south of Islay - Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig 10 and now Ardbeg 10. I'll kick it off today by comparing Ardbeg 10 and Lagavulin 16. We're going just taste today and will get into more details over the coming days.

### Lagavulin 16

This is the expression I'm most familiar with. The 15 mL neat pour today is the same as the last time I had it - peaty, smoky, medicinal, complex finish. I'm getting more bitter notes than ever before through this comparison.

### Ardbeg 10

Alright, standard Ardbeg. What you got?

* Nose: Peat smoke, similar to the Lagavulin. Some light citrus notes underneath the smoke. Not quite as medicinal as the Lagavulin. The smoke seems a bit more intense.
* Taste: Ashy in the back of my mouth as the whisky swirls around my tongue. Some numbing.
* Finish: Yum, this is good. Very long. Some drying. More intense smoke than the Lagavulin. But also some lighter citrus notes like on the nose. Less complex than the Lagavulin but what's here is incredibly pleasant. A sip can last minutes.

### Conclusion

Wow. OK. I'm an Ardbeg guy. I'm still a Lagavulin guy but the Ardbeg really impresses me. I can't wait to do an Ardbeg vertical and compare the base expression with the Uigeadail and Corryvreckan. But first, we need to see how the Laphroiag holds up... tomorrow...
