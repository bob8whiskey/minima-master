I was hoping to try out some new smoky whiskys while on travel. Unfortunately, the work schedule hasn't been amenable to visiting bars. Fortunately, some Lagavulin 16 and Laphroaig 10 made the trip with me in some [little nippers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWRC65W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I had a short neat pour of Lagavulin with the sunrise. The whisky cuts through the morning chill and warms your heart. The complexity puts you in a contemplative mood to think about the upcoming day.

I returned long after the sun set to try the Laga16 and Laph10 alongside a burger. The complexities of the Laga16 were lost in the pairing but the more straight forward profile of the Laph10 held up well. It's probably best to save the Laga for soolo enjoyment or lighter flavor pairings.

Whisky Bob signing off.
