It's easy to get overly excited when jumping into a new hobby, especially one as delicious as whiskey. It can also be fiscally and physically dangerous when jumping into a new hobby, especially one as delicious as whiskey. Alcoholism is far too real and can capture anyone. I really want to keep this a fun and sustainable hobby. But just a hobby.

For those reasons, I will take some planned days off of drinking here and there. One reason for this blog is to write every day so I'll fill my #NoWhiskey days with accountability posts like this, book reviews, or boring history lessons.

I'll also keep a budget and share spending here. I'm choosing to share this info because 1. it helps keep me accountable and 2. it might be useful for readers to see prices and price out their own whiskey adventures.

I talked the budget over with Mrs. Whiskey and we agreed on a target of $1200-$1500 for the year with a hard cap of $1825. These figures account for me giving up takeout coffee and less photography equipment in our overall budget. The lower end figure is based on $4/day with 300 days of drinking. The hard cap is based on $5/day drinking every day. While I won't be drinking every day, the higher number gives me some flexibility to freely share samples with friends. This whole journey will be way more fun with friends!

I've spent about $500 year to date and have $200 ready to plop down at a New Hampshire liquor barn (live tax free or die, baby!). This inventory should set me up pretty well for the next 6-8 months.

These figures might seem extravagant to many or laughable to a few but it works for us. Hopefully the transparency is helpful, dear reader.

Whiskey Bob signing off.
