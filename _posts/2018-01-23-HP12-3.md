Starting off with Highland Park 12 neat in a Glencairn. Lots of sweetness on the nose with some alcohol burn. Get a lot of smokiness in the mouth when I close my mouth and breathe through my nose. Add a few drops of filtered water to the dram. The sweetness is subdued and I get more smoke on the nose now. Feels more watery in my mouth (duh). After sitting a bit, get a bit more winey type of smell. There's a bit of meat flavor up front that's quickly overcome by the smoke. Leave it sitting awhile and get a bit more butterscotch on the nose. Think I like it neat better though I appreciate some new stuff being brought out with water.

Whisky Bob signing off.
